        abstract: "The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) will make data from the 2000 Census of Population and Housing of the United States available to social and behavioral scientists at colleges and universities throughout the country. In doing so, it will collect, preserve, enhance, and distribute data developed by the U.S. Census Bureau. In addition, ICPSR will provide training to data users and data librarians in the academic community in order to ensure the most effective use of these data by the largest possible number of users. The project will enable researchers to use these data efficiently and economically for research and instructional purposes. This project has six key activities: (1) Acquisition and long-term archiving of substantially all data produced by the 2000 Censuses of Population and of Housing; (2) Re-formatting census data to facilitate use in statistical analysis programs; (3) Development of standardized documentation for census data that is compliant with the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) standard; (4) Development of new data products, including special subsamples and special summary files, that serve the needs of academic researchers; (5) Provision of web-based access to the data that will include a data-finder and custom subsetting capabilities; and (6) Provision of training and outreach activities to encourage use of the data.",

        abstract: "This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) grant provides funding to assess participants’ crisis exposure, their threat perceptions, their self- and response-efficacy, their emotional responses and their engagement in health protective behaviors as relevant to COVID-19 and to hurricanes. As the 2020 hurricane season commences, millions of Americans residing in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts will face the likely possibility of dual crises – COVID-19 and hurricane exposure – with competing mitigation strategies. Experts project that there will be four hurricanes that will develop into major hurricanes (Categories 3, 4, or 5) in the Atlantic during the 2020 hurricane season (June 1st – November 30th). Concurrently, many in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states are seeing alarming increases in confirmed case of COVID-19. The confluence of crises in communities at risk for hurricane exposure may create an untenable and tragic situation where millions of people may be suddenly asked to flee from an approaching major hurricane to shelters, potentially imperiling themselves and others to COVID-19. Hurricane-force winds further compound the risk given the high potential for Coronavirus to spread via respiratory droplets, potentially creating super-spreading environments and fueling fears about going to shelters. Repeated exposure to such crises can tax individuals’ emotional states, leading to difficulties in functioning and decision making over time. The important theoretical and practical question is: “How do people make proactive decisions regarding the threat of a hurricane in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic?”",
